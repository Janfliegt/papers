1. attention:
   advantage:
       no conditional independence assumption
   disadvantage:
         too flexibel that it allows non-sequential alignments. This is fine in MT but for asr the input and output generally proceed in the same order
2. CTC:
   advantage:
         strictly monotonic alignment using DP
   disadvantage: 
         requires LM and graph-based decoding to obtain good performance unless huge training data available
3. training: use CTC as an auxilary task to regularize the attention-based encoder network
4. decoding:
     1.decoder part:only decode the output of the decoder
        disadvantage:
          a.may include deletion and insetion errors because of its flexibel alignment property, which can attend to any portion of the
          encoder state swquence to predict the next label
          b. it can prematurely predict the end-of-sentence label, making the hypothesis too short
          c. it can attend to the same portions as those attended to before, making the hypothesis too lang
     2. some techniques to slove the disadvantages:
        a. length penalty -> TODO
        b. coverge term -> TODO
     3. this paper: joint decoding:
        a.rescoring 
        b.one pass
